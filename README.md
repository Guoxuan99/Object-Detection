Extra Project - Clone of existed project online - Object Detection - Can identify normal item in our daily life through picture and real time video streaming.

From this project, i get to know hhow to perform object detection in both images and video streams using: OpenCV, Python, and Deep Learning.

This is my first time to "get my hands dirty" on object detection related project and it really give me a lot of inspiration to try out more on this topic.
